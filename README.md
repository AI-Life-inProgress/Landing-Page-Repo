# Landing Page - Project #2

This repository contains a basic blue themed landing page design template using some of the CSS flexbox features from the 'Foundations' course in 'The Odin Project'. Please note this is a non mobile-responsive web page in it's early development phase. 

All images used in this project have been sourced from free image sites.

The skills developed in this project: The positioning of different HTML elements and how they interact with each other and the box model along with CSS and using the CSS flexbox layout.
